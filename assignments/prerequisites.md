# Assignment Prerequisites

Please go over the mandatory prerequisites below.

* [Working Environment](#working-environment)
* [Setup the assignment](#setup-the-assignment)
* [General Guidelines](#general-guidelines)
* [Read more](#read-more)

## Working Environment
- You'll need a local workstation (laptop/desktop) with the ability to run VMs.
- Install [VirtualBox](<https://www.virtualbox.org/>) on your workstation
- Install [Vagrant](<https://www.vagrantup.com/>) on your workstation

## Setup the assignment
- Mirror this git repo using the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository). Then clone it locally. 

>IMPORTANT: **DO NOT fork this repo!!! **
-  Create a branch called `solution` and make all your changes in that branch (do not delete files from the master branch!)

- `cd` to the vagrant directory in the repo  - `materials/vagrant`.

- Run `vagrant up` and make sure you can ssh into both machines from your repo directory using `vagrant ssh server1` and `vagrant ssh server2`

- This is the servers infromation 
```
name|server1|server2
----|-------|-------
ip  |192.168.60.10|192.168.60.11
```
> IMPORTANT: the infrastructure should work out of the box. There's no hidden part of the exercise in which you need to debug vagrant/virtualbox.

## General Guidelines
- Your code should be as simple as possible.

- Your code should be tested by running `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` and see all fixes and tasks are implemented automatically.

> IMPORTANT: The `vagrant up` command must finish successfully (with return code 0).
- We don't do code reviews. Our tests run automatically, so make sure everything runs and finishes successfuly before you submit your assigment for review.

- Do not change the directory structure. The automatic tests depend on the directory structure staying the same as when you clone the repo.
