## EXERCISE 4

We would like to ssh between the servers using their names rather than their ip addresses.

> NOTE: In order to test this, run `vagrant ssh server1` and from there you should be able to run `ssh server2` to the second server.

Please add the commands required to ssh between the two servers using names (server1 and server2)
* for server1 update this file: `exercise4-fix_server1.sh`
* for server2 update this file: `exercise4-fix_server2.sh`


> Once you're done continue to the next exercise
